Change log for this release:
http://build.clojure.org/job/clojurescript-release/19/

This release depends on the latest version of the Google Closure Library, r2029. You can also depend on it explicitly:

    [org.clojure/google-closure-library "0.0-2029"]

ClojureScript does NOT depend directly on the Google Closure Library third-party extensions, but you can get it:

    [org.clojure/google-closure-library-third-party "0.0-2029"]
