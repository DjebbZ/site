The primary feature of this release is a new experimental compiler
flag - :parallel-build. If set to true the compiler will leverage
multiple threads to compile ClojureScript sources. Users have reported
signifant gains for cold development and production builds.

This release also includes a variety of small fixes and changes.

As always feedback welcome!
