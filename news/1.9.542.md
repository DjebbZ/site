This release is primarily about staying in sync with the latest changes to spec. It
also includes a small but significant enhancement to REPLs to allow handling multiple forms.

As always, feedback welcome!

### Enhancements
* CLJS-1572: REPL doesn't give error for expressions with too many right parentheses

### Changes

* CLJS-2013 - Add MapEntry type
* CLJS-2015: Self-host: `defmacro` should return the Var

### Fixes
* CLJS-485: RegExp flags are being dropped by string/replace

* CLJS-2010: refer-clojure :rename throws on valid invocations
* CLJS-2007: Whitespace optimizations should respect :main option.
