This release fixes a cljs.spec bug around instrumented multi-arity
fns. It also includes various fixes and performance enhancements from
Clojure. Another performance related change is writing out analysis
caches as Transit if transit-clj is available. This is automatic and
requires no configuration and gives a modest speed bump when launching
REPLs.

As always feedback welcome!

### Enhancements
* Write analysis caches as Transit if transit-clj available

### Changes
* Clojure [1f25347]
* Clojure [47b8d6b]
* Optimize seq (&) destructuring as per commit ([0aa3467]) of Clojure

### Fixes
* CLJS-1611: Function arity dispatch returns arity
* only print specs in REPL if we actually have some
* CLJS-1663: Calling instrumented multi-arity function causes exception
* CLJS-1650: `cljs.reader/read-map` now returns array-map/hash-map based on the size of the sequence.
