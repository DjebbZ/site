This release brings cljs.spec to parity with Clojure
1.9.0-alpha10. This release also includes a large number of
enhancements to the ns form:

* :refer now features macro inference. There is no longer any need
  to supply both :refer and :refer-macros in the same :require, the
  compiler will figure it out.

* clojure.* namespaces will now automatically be aliased to their
  ClojureScript equivalents. For example this means that the following
  is perfectly valid ClojureScript:

```clj
(ns foo.bar
  (:require [clojure.spec :refer [fspec]]))
```

  This feature and the previous one should significantly reduce reader
  conditional usage in ns forms.

* thanks to Antonio Monteiro we now support :rename

We also have a new feature that is relevant for tooling such as
Figwheel and cljs-devtools - :preloads. This should now be the
standard way to inject some bit of side-effecting setup after core but
before user code (i.e. connecting REPLs to standard ports, etc.).

There are of course many various small fixes and enhancements, so
a very big thank you to everyone that has contributed.

As always feedback welcome!
