This is a significant feature release.

The first new feature is externs inference. This should greatly ease
the integration of 3rd party JavaScript libraries incompatible
with Google Closure advanced compilation. By treating the externs
problem as a type-hinting one - we can automatically generate the
required externs for you. This new feature should be considered
of alpha quality and subject to change. Still, feedback is greatly
appreciated to help us better understand how to best deliver this
enhancement.

For details please look at the new guide:<br>
https://clojurescript.org/guides/externs

The second new feature is much more comprehensive support for
JavaScript modules. We now have a good story for integrating the
various kinds of JavaScript modules into a ClojureScript project
build without resorting to JavaScript build tools. This feature
even includes the consumption of modules directly from NPM.

There are far too many details to cover in this release announcement
so once again refer to the guide:<br>
https://clojurescript.org/guides/javascript-modules

Like externs inference this feature is alpha and subject to change.
Again feedback is critical to guiding this enhancement in the
right direction.

I'd like to especially call out Maria Geller's Google Summer of Code work
here around these two major features. This work began almost 2 years
and it's nice to see the long term planning come together so well.

There are quite a few performancement enhancements in this release
related to compiler startup time as well as numerous fixes from
many members of the community.

Congratulations to everyone involved and happy hacking!
