This release fixes several cljs.spec issues. It also includes a new
compiler option - :preloads. This feature is designed to simplify (but
not limited to) the loading of development time side effects such as
enabling printing, REPL connections, and browser tool
integration. With :preloads you may now specify a sequence of
namespaces as symbols to load in order immediately after cljs.core. This also
means there's a path for providing typical boilerplate as documented
namespaces that users can specify in their dev builds.

As always feedback welcome!
