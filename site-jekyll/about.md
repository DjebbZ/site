ClojureScript is pretty great and deserves an equally great website & branding!

__cljs.info__ is a community effort to meet this goal; we currently have a neat
logo, a (rough) website started, a ton of documentation work, and an
open-source book that will be making its way here.

We want to simplify content management, collaboration, and deployment for this
website as much as possible so it can stay around, be adapted, and change hands
for as long as it needs to.  Thus, we are using a Jekyll site deployed to
GitHub pages, with some ClojureScript for future dynamic parts of course!

Follow our development here:

- twitter updates: [@cljsinfo](http://twitter.com/cljsinfo)

Long live ClojureScript!
