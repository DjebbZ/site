<dt>ClojureScript</dt> <dd> ClojureScript is a Clojure to JavaScript compiler.
(More details on the landing page and docs.)  We think the language/community
is pretty great and deserves an equally great website & branding!

<dt>cljs.info</dt>
<dd>
cljs.info is a community effort to create a website and branding for
ClojureScript. We currently have a neat logo, a (rough) website started, a ton
of documentation work, and an open-source book on its way.
 <div class="post-meta">_cljs.info will be the domain of the website when completed_</div>
