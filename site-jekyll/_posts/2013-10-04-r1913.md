Enhancements: 

* Under incremental compilation reset the namespace for the file, this way you get var warnings for example when functions get renamed
* ns refers and uses for libs and macros are now checked - warning now issued if var does not exist

Fixes:

* CLJS-600 & CLJS-604: LazySeq regression
