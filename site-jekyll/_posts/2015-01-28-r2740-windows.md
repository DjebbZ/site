The primary reason for this release is to bring all the benefits of
0.0-2727 to Windows users.

### Changes
* local :foreign-libs can precisely override upstream :foreign-libs
* :foreign-libs :file-min is only used under :advanced optimizations
* file generated by supplying :main now idempotent
* more informative error if :main incorrectly supplied

### Fixes
* many fixes around file/resource handling for Windows users
