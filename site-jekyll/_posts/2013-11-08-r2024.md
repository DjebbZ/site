The main change was fixing a regression introduced by relative source
maps where ClojureScript source files would be copied over to the output
directory only once.

Enhancements:

* The data structure construction fns are now inlined, this
  avoids the overhead of a variadic call.

Bug fixes:

* CLJS-528: warn on protocol extension of basic JavaScript natives
