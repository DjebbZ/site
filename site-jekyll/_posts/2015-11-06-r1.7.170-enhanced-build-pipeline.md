release_version: "1.7.170"
title:  "r1.7.170 - Enhanced Build Pipeline"
author: "David Nolen"

This release includes a major refactor of the build pipeline thanks to
Juho Teperi. This change along with some greatly simplified
recompilation logic will mean much faster cold build times for larger
projects (some users have already reported >10X).

This is a breaking change for existing tooling. You will need to
upgrade lein-cljsbuild, lein-figwheel, and boot-cljs if you intend to
adopt this version of ClojureScript. All the mentioned tools have
already accounted for this change. Refer to the appropriate
documentation for your tooling to determine which version number you
should adopt.

Other interesting changes and fixes include newer Google Closure
Compiler and Library dependencies, self hosting tweaks, a Google
Closure modules (:modules compiler option) regression,
improved warnings, and minor REPL enhancements.

As always feedback welcome!
