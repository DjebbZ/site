The main reason for this release is to address a critical bug under 
Safari 7.X which does not correctly implement Math.imul breaking 
collections that require hashing. 

### Changes 
* Experimental support for ES6 Map/Set interface 

### Fixes 
* CLJS-823: use non-native imul in Safari 
* CLJS-810: re-matches returns [] if string is nil
