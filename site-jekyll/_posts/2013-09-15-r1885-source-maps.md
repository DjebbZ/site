The biggest change in this release thanks to Sean Grove - much improved source maps. You can provide a :source-map option to the compiler to name the source map file. Feedback on this significant enhancement welcome.

Enhancements: 

* Accurate source maps!

Changes:

* cljs.core/format based on goog.string/format backed out
* set-print-fn! no longer exported

Fixes:

* CLJS-588: allow upstream :foreign-libs to be used
