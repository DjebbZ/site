Coming soon to a Maven repository near you:

    [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-1586"]

List of changes:
http://build.clojure.org/job/clojurescript-release/22/

Notable change: fix for CLJS-418, the broken dependency chain between the Google Closure Library and its third-party extensions. ClojureScript's dependency tree now includes the third-party extensions by default.
