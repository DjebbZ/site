This release is mostly to address compatability issues with the latest
release of core.async.

Bug fixes:

* CLJS-663: keyword too permissive on inputs
* CLJS-660: keyword fn behavior inconsistent with Clojure
* CLJS-528: Warns on any attempted extension of protocols
  to base JavaScript types, using the new warning system.
